The Simple-Computer-Simulator is designed to allow a beginning
computer science student have the opportunity to create a working computer
simulation.

The design of this was intended to support the widest audience possible and
as a result, I have chosen to select DHTML as the medium for delivery.
This should allow all students to have access without the need for additional
software or tools.

The program comes in two basic parts:

The first part provides a description of simple logic gates, along with a
working demonstration of each.

The second part allows a student to link the gates together to form more 
complex logic circuits that will illustrate how digital circuits are designed.

Each of these sections will come with a complete set of reading material
on-line in addition to a progressive set of questions to provide the student
with much-needed practice.

The long term intent is to create a set of open course-ware for students
to study computer science.
